# this is a program to find the optimal way to allocate money each month

# the idea is to model each debt as an "organism" that has to be fed
# the organism object will have a status function that will allow the budgeter to determine
# which organisms are most in need

# i believe starting out with the 50/30/20 budget isn't a bad starting point
# that's 50% on necessities
# 30% on wants
# 20% on savings/debt

# the general work flow should be triggered by money coming in
# the budgeter should run and determine how much money should go to each
# bin.

# to start with we will probably run the budgeter manually
# input the income
# and let it run

# organism setup will also largely be handled by hand to start with
